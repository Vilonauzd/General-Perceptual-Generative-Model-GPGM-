Abstract

This paper proposes a new foundation-model paradigm: the General Perceptual Generative Model (GPGM). Unlike today’s large language models (LLMs), which are trained primarily on symbolic text corpora, GPGM emphasizes non-textual sensory grounding.

Visual, auditory, tactile, and thermal data streams are paired immutably during training, forming the model’s core weights. Text is layered on only after perceptual grounding has matured, preventing hallucinations and enabling more embodied causal reasoning.

1. Motivation

Modern foundation models learn language first and perception later. Humans learn the opposite. Infants form clusters of sensory associations — sight, sound, touch, temperature, affect — long before they learn words.

Text-centric AI is powerful but brittle. Captions are noisy, incomplete, and biased. Models trained to interpolate words hallucinate because they lack grounding in lived perception. By reversing the sequence — perception before language — GPGM can anchor AI in the physical world and reduce hallucination risk.

2. Core Principles

Immutable multisensory pairing. Every training episode is captured simultaneously across modalities. Segments are valid only if all streams are present and time-synchronized.

Fail-closed capture. Data integrity is enforced with redundancy, hashes, and wipe-on-failure rules. If one stream is missing, the entire episode is discarded.

No text in core weights. Training excludes symbolic language. Latent clusters form directly from perceptual co-occurrence.

Layered symbolic interface. Words, captions, or phonemes are introduced later as optional overlays — much like how children name objects after perceiving them.

3. Data Specification

Building a dataset for GPGM requires capturing multimodal episodes with precision and integrity.

Modalities and capture hardware:
	•	Visual: Stereo/volumetric rigs (e.g., ZED 2i, Azure Kinect), lidar arrays for depth.
	•	Audio: Ambisonic microphones (e.g., Soundfield SPS200, Zoom H3-VR).
	•	Tactile: Haptic gloves (HaptX, SenseGlove) or vibration sensors.
	•	Thermal: FLIR thermal imagers and distributed probes.
	•	Affect (optional): Wearables like Empatica E4 for heart rate and galvanic response.

Synchronization and integrity:
	•	Time alignment via IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP).
	•	Segments sealed using cryptographic checksums and Merkle trees.
	•	Episodes divided into fixed 10-second windows. If any modality fails, the segment is wiped.

Data pipeline:
	•	Encoded into efficient formats (ProRes, AmbiX, HDF5).
	•	Metadata includes timestamps, GPS, context descriptors, calibration states.
	•	Each episode becomes an atomic perceptual “ledger entry.”

Pilot scale:
	•	~50 TB of multimodal data across urban, rural, and lab environments.
	•	Enough to probe whether emergent perceptual clusters align with human judgment.

4. Training Objectives

The GPGM is optimized to model perception through three objectives:

Contrastive alignment. Align modalities that co-occur in the same episode (e.g., fire sound, flickering light, rising heat). Misaligned modalities are repelled. Implemented via InfoNCE/CLIP-style dual encoders.

Predictive modeling. Anticipate the next sensory state. Example: footsteps grow louder as a walker approaches, thermal gradients rise as a kettle boils. Transformer architectures model these temporal dynamics.

Clustering of emergent concepts. Natural perceptual categories form without labels. Multiple “glass breaking” episodes cluster into a shared latent representation across vision, audio, and vibration.

Symbolic overlay (optional). Lightweight language models later map words onto perceptual clusters (“fire,” “glass,” “stone”), ensuring language is an accessory, not the foundation.

5. Infrastructure Proposal

Scaling GPGM requires purpose-built infrastructure to capture, store, and validate sensory data at scale.

Capture fleet. Retrofitted vehicles (mapping fleets, freight carriers) with multimodal rigs. Human drivers contribute affective and physiological signals.

Storage crates. Hot-swappable DAS/JBOD modules allow drivers to replace storage at depots. Each crate is sealed, hashed, and offloaded.

Silo stations. Depot-edge servers ingest crates, verify checksums, and upload data to distributed storage networks (e.g., STORJ) for scale-out.

Privacy and consent. Human data (biometric/affect) collected only with consent, de-identified at the edge. Failures trigger secure cryptographic wiping.

6. Applications
	•	Hallucination-free AI. Models that generate consistent multisensory output without textual artifacts.
	•	Grounded reasoning. Predicts causal outcomes — fires burn, glass shatters — from grounded perceptual models.
	•	Next-gen HCI. Beyond text: AI “talks back” in sound, images, and tactile signals.
	•	Robotics. Perceptual clusters transfer directly to embodied agents.

7. Research Roadmap
	1.	Pilot dataset. 50–100 TB controlled multimodal episodes.
	2.	Prototype GPGM core. Contrastive + predictive training across modalities.
	3.	Evaluation. Test emergent clusters against human judgment.
	4.	Symbolic overlay. Introduce minimal text mappings.
	5.	Scale-up. Expand fleets, add modalities like smell and chemical sensing.

8. Related Work (and Why It Falls Short)
	•	AV-HuBERT (Meta, 2021): Audio + lip movement only. Lacks tactile, thermal, affect.
	•	ImageBind (Meta, 2023): Aligns six modalities but relies on loosely paired data, not immutable episodes.
	•	OpenAI Jukebox (2020): Audio-only. Vocal realism, but no grounding in vision or touch.
	•	Robotics multimodal research: Narrowly scoped to tasks like grasping, not general perception.

Key contrast: GPGM demands simultaneous, immutable capture across modalities. No stitched proxies. No partials.

9. Conclusion

The General Perceptual Generative Model (GPGM) represents a shift away from text-dominated architectures toward perception-first intelligence.

By training models to see, hear, and feel before they ever “speak,” GPGM aims to reduce hallucinations, improve grounding, and emulate the developmental path of human cognition.

It is not a finished system but an open proposal — a call to researchers and engineers to consider perception-first learning as the next leap forward in artificial intelligence.
