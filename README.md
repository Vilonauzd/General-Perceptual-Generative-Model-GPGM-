## Abstract  
Modern foundation models learn language first and perception later. Humans learn the opposite. What if our models did too?

GPGM (General Perceptual Generative Model) is a perception-first paradigm. Its core weights are trained only on co-occurring non-text signals: vision, audio, tactile/vibration, thermal, and optionally human affect. Then, text is layered on as an overlay—not as the primary foundation.

---

## 1. Motivation  
Text-centric pretraining produces fluent systems that still hallucinate, because they interpolate symbols rather than model reality. Captions are noisy, biased, and incomplete, leading to brittle reasoning and weak physical grounding.

Infants, by contrast, learn via multisensory clustering before they ever speak. GPGM inverts the current AI stack: perception → inference → language, instead of language → inference → perception.

## 2. Core Principles  

GPGM is built on four pillars:

- **Immutable multisensory pairing**: Every training episode must contain synchronized streams across modalities.  
- **Fail-closed capture**: If one modality fails (camera drop, audio glitch, sensor fault), the entire episode is discarded. No stitching or proxy data.  
- **No text in core weights**: Core modeling operates purely on sensory correlation, not symbolic signals.  
- **Layered symbolic interface**: Text or phoneme labels can later be mapped onto clusters, but only after perceptual organization has emerged.

## 3. Data Specification  

Designing the dataset is critical. Below is how each piece fits.

### Modalities & Capture Hardware  
- **Vision**: Stereo or volumetric camera rigs (e.g. ZED 2i, Azure Kinect) with optionally lidar for geometry.  
- **Audio**: Ambisonic microphone arrays (Soundfield SPS200, Zoom H3-VR).  
- **Tactile**: Haptic gloves or contact sensors to capture force, pressure, vibration.  
- **Thermal**: IR thermal imaging modules and ambient temperature probes.  
- **Affect (optional)**: Biometric wearables (HR, GSR) to encode human internal states.

### Synchronization & Integrity  
- Use IEEE-1588 PTP for sub-millisecond synchronization across sensors.  
- Segment into fixed 10-second episodes.  
- Seal each episode with cryptographic hashes and Merkle roots.  
- Reject and wipe any episode missing full modality alignment.

### Data Pipeline & Storage  
- Encode streams in high-fidelity formats (ProRes / lossless audio / HDF5 for tactile/thermal).  
- Metadata includes timestamps, geolocation, calibration, environment tags.  
- Use hot-swappable storage crates (NVMe/DAS/JBOD) in field units.  
- At depots, crates dock to **silo stations** that ingest, verify, and offload to distributed storage (e.g. STORJ).

## 4. Training Objectives  

GPGM’s learning is structured around three core objectives:

### Contrastive Alignment  
Align embeddings of modalities that co-occur in an episode (vision ↔ audio, tactile ↔ thermal). Use InfoNCE / dual-encoder loss. Misaligned modalities are pushed apart.

### Predictive Modeling  
Given N−1 time slices, predict the Nth slice across modalities. E.g. thermal gradient rises, audio intensifies, visual flicker evolves. Employ transformer or autoregressive cross-modal architectures.

### Emergent Clustering  
Clusters form in the latent embedding space corresponding to natural perceptual categories: fire crackling, footsteps on stone, wind rustle. These clusters emerge *without any text labels*.

### Symbolic Overlay (Optional)  
Once perceptual clusters are stable, a lightweight language model can be trained to map symbolic tokens onto clusters, without ever feeding text into the core perceptual weights.

## 5. Infrastructure & Deployment  


### Field Units & Capture Fleet  
Each vehicle or mobile rig carries sensor arrays, a crate interface, and a timing cluster. Human participants (e.g. drivers) may contribute affective sensors optionally.

### Storage Crates & Depot Silo  
- Crates: hot-swappable NVMe / U.2 / JBOD enclosures.  
- Depots host silo stations: each crate docks, undergoes integrity verification, and data is ingested.  
- After verification, data replicates to distributed cloud storage (STORJ or equivalent).  
- Crates that fail integrity are wiped cryptographically and quarantined.

### Networking & Data Flow  
- Depot-to-cloud: multi-gigabit links or fiber to handle large daily offloads.  
- Edge compute: depot servers perform de-identification, manifest signing, error-checking before cloud handoff.  
- Audit: random sample integrity re-checks post-upload.

## 6. Applications  

- **Hallucination-free generative AI**: Produce consistent multisensory output.  
- **Grounded reasoning**: Causality based on perceptual data, not text interpolation.  
- **Human-AI interfaces**: Systems that respond in sound, image, or tactile feedback.  
- **Robotics and embodied transfer**: Maps perceptual clusters to robotic sensors & actuators.

## 7. Research Roadmap  

1. Pilot dataset (50-100 TB of controlled episodes).  
2. Pretrain GPGM core via contrastive + predictive losses.  
3. Evaluate cluster alignment with human perception.  
4. Introduce symbolic overlay to test control.  
5. Scale across fleets and expand modalities (smell, chemical sensors).

## 8. Related Work & Critical Gap  

- **AV-HuBERT (Meta)**: pairs audio and lip motion, but lacks tactile, thermal, affect, and immutable co-occurrence.  
- **ImageBind (Meta)**: aligns many modalities, but based on loose pairings, not strict synchronous capture.  
- **OpenAI Jukebox**: audio-only generative model; lacks grounding in vision or tactile context.  
- **Robotics multimodal models**: often task-specific, limited modality sets, no unified generative core.

GPGM’s core distinction is its insistence on **full, immutable, simultaneous capture across all modalities**. Anything less is insufficient.

## 9. Conclusion  

The General Perceptual Generative Model (GPGM) proposes reversing the AI hierarchy: learn perception first, language second. It's a radical departure from text-first models, but may be the path forward to systems that generalize, reason, and hallucinate less.
