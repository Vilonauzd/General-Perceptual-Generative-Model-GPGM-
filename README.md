## Abstract

This paper proposes a new foundation-model paradigm: the **General Perceptual Generative Model (GPGM)**. Unlike current large language models (LLMs), which are trained primarily on symbolic text corpora, GPGM emphasizes *non-textual sensory grounding*.

Visual, auditory, tactile, and thermal data streams are **paired immutably** during training, forming the model’s core weights. Text is layered on only after perceptual grounding has matured, preventing hallucinations and improving causal and embodied understanding.

---

## 1. Motivation

* **Limits of text-first training**: LLMs interpolate written language but lack grounding in physical perception, leading to hallucinations.
* **Human analogy**: Infants learn by clustering multimodal sensory inputs (sight, sound, touch, affect) before later mapping them to symbolic language.
* **Opportunity**: By emulating this developmental trajectory, AI systems can learn grounded world models that are less prone to artifacts and more capable of genuine perceptual generalization.

---

## 2. Core Principles

* **Immutable multisensory pairing**: Every recorded event is captured *simultaneously* across modalities (vision, audio, tactile, thermal, affect). Segments are valid only if all streams are present and time-synchronized.
* **No text in core weights**: Training excludes language tokens. Latent clusters form directly from perceptual co-occurrence.
* **Layered symbolic interface**: Text or phoneme labels are introduced later as optional overlays, analogous to how humans learn to name objects they already perceive.
* **Fail-closed capture**: Data integrity is enforced through redundancy, hashing, and secure wipe policies; partial or stitched segments are disallowed.

---

## 3. Data Specification

* **Modalities**: Stereo/volumetric video, ambisonic audio, tactile sensors, temperature probes, optional biometric/affect markers.
* **Segmentation**: Fixed-length atomic windows (e.g., 10s) sealed only if all modalities pass integrity gates.
* **Metadata**: Timestamps, geo-coordinates, context descriptors, sensor calibration states.
* **Scale**: Millions of multimodal “episodes” across diverse contexts (urban, rural, highway, human interactions).

---

## 4. Training Objectives

* **Contrastive**: Align sensory embeddings across modalities (video ↔ audio, tactile ↔ temperature).
* **Predictive**: Anticipate the next sensory state (physics-grounded temporal modeling).
* **Clustering**: Emergent units form natural categories (e.g., “hot crackling fire” without labels).
* **Optional symbolic fine-tuning**: Introduce small amounts of text/phoneme labels for alignment with human language.

---

## 5. Infrastructure Proposal

* **Capture fleet**: Retrofitted vehicles (e.g., mapping fleets, freight carriers) with hot-swappable *storage crates* docked at depots.
* **In-cabin sensing**: Human drivers contribute facial expressions, posture, voice prosody, and physiological markers to ground perception in lived affect.
* **Silo stations**: Edge servers at depots ingest crates, verify integrity, and backhaul to distributed cloud storage (e.g., decentralized networks).
* **Privacy**: On-edge de-identification, consent tiers, and secure cryptographic wiping for failures.

---

## 6. Applications

* **Hallucination-free generative models**: Systems that generate sensory-consistent outputs across modalities.
* **Grounded reasoning**: Predict physical consequences of actions (“fire burns,” “glass shatters”) without symbolic teaching.
* **Next-gen HCI**: Text becomes an optional convenience layer; models can also “talk back” in sound, imagery, or tactile signals.
* **Robotics**: Direct transfer of perceptual clusters to embodied agents.

## 7. Research Roadmap

1. **Pilot dataset**: 50–100 TB multimodal capture, short episodes, controlled contexts.
2. **Prototype GPGM core**: Contrastive + predictive pretraining without text.
3. **Evaluation**: Test emergent perceptual clusters against human judgements.
4. **Layer symbolic overlay**: Minimal text mapping to probe controllability.
5. **Scale-up**: Expand fleet capture, broaden sensory range, explore new modalities (smell, chemical sensors).

## 8. Related Work (and Why It Falls Short)

Several projects hint at the direction of perceptual grounding, but none meet the requirements of the **General Perceptual Generative Model (GPGM)**. Each is limited by partial modalities or by lack of immutability in data capture:

* **AV-HuBERT (Meta, 2021)** – Self-supervised speech representation using paired audio and lip movement. Effective for speech recognition, but excludes tactile, temperature, and affect streams, breaking the circle of immutability.
* **ImageBind (Meta, 2023)** – Aligns six modalities (image, audio, text, depth, thermal, IMU) in a shared embedding. However, modalities are not collected as immutable co-occurrences; training relies on loosely associated data rather than synchronized sensory episodes.
* **OpenAI Jukebox (2020)** – Audio-only generative model for music and vocals. Demonstrates “babbling” vocal realism, but suffers from linguistic incoherence precisely because no visual or tactile grounding is present.
* **Robotics multimodal research** – A range of studies integrate vision and tactile data for grasping or navigation, but these are narrowly scoped task models, not general perceptual generative systems.

**Key contrast:** GPGM requires all modalities to be captured **simultaneously and immutably**, forming an inseparable data record. Existing models are *fractional*—each explores a slice of the perceptual field, but none implement the closed, fail-closed circle of co-occurrence that prevents artifact stitching or modality drift.

## 9. Conclusion

The **General Perceptual Generative Model (GPGM)** represents a shift away from text-dominated architectures toward *perception-first AI*.

By training models to *see, hear, and feel* before *speaking*, GPGM aims to reduce hallucinations, improve grounding, and emulate the developmental path of human intelligence.
